# Global South Forest Fires Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes forest fire patterns in Algeria as a case study for understanding fire risks in the Global South. Using data from the Algerian Forest Fires dataset, we explore the relationships between various meteorological factors and fire occurrence, and develop predictive models for the Fire Weather Index (FWI).

## Contents
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks:

1. `1_forest_fires_analysis.ipynb`: 
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Algerian Forest Fires dataset
   - Visualization of key trends and patterns
   - Initial insights into factors influencing fire risks

2. `2_forest_fires_predictive_modeling.ipynb`:
   - Feature selection and preprocessing
   - Implementation of multiple machine learning models (Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet)
   - Model evaluation and comparison
   - Interpretation of results and their implications for fire management

## Key Findings
- Identified clear seasonal patterns in fire occurrences
- Established strong correlations between weather conditions and fire risks
- Developed highly accurate predictive models for the Fire Weather Index (FWI)
- Highlighted the potential impact of climate change on future fire risks

## Significance
This analysis contributes to the broader field of climate change research, offering insights that can be applied to forest fire management across the Global South. The methodologies and findings presented here can serve as a foundation for similar studies in other regions facing increased fire risks due to changing climate conditions.

## Future Directions
- Extend the analysis to other regions in the Southern Hemisphere
- Incorporate additional data sources (e.g., vegetation indices, human activity patterns)
- Develop real-time monitoring systems based on the predictive models

## Usage
To explore this project:
1. Start with `1_algerian_forest_fires_analysis.ipynb` for an understanding of the dataset and initial insights.
2. Proceed to `2_forest_fires_predictive_modeling.ipynb` to see how these insights are translated into predictive models.

Each notebook contains detailed comments and explanations to guide you through the analysis process.
